Hello All

My Name is Mark aka H1ggz33

I have worked in IT for around 20 years, but I am still new to programming and GitHub,

I have had some exposeure to programing over the years but I have nether learnt a full langage

I learnt a little bit of C+ at college, where I made a Password program which would check
- charactors 
- uppercase/lowercase
- password length

I have written batch files which can
- retrive Sieral Numbers from programs
- offer choices , i.e check press 1 to get software version, press 2 to patch software, press 3 to exit
- patch software , i.e launch update program, or replace files
- retrive windows PATHS and the add new paths and re-write back to windows

I have also done some CSS and HTML coding 

I am now looking forward to learning some more.

Regards
H1ggz33
